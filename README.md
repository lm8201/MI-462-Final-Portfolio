# LeeAnn Markwalter - The Future of Data Science: Design Thinking, Feedback Loops, and ML OPS 

  Design thinking is an innovative project management approach to solving data science problems. Design thinking is a four step process that involves discovering many concepts, defining information into a focused and succinct analysis, designing a prototype to elicit user feedback and solve concepts, and determining the best idea to move forward to implement. Design thinking involves brainstorming, developing rapid prototypes, and failing fast to determine the best data science solution for a business problem. 
  
  A feedback loop is a cause and effect relationship where data is responded to based on recognition of an outcome, and that data is used to inform future decisions in an analogous situation. Feedback loops are used to develop prescriptive analytics, or understanding why something is happening. 
  
  Machine learning ops introduces new assets of data and models into the software development lifecycle. By defining processes and adding discipline to the development and deployment of ML models, ML Ops helps to make models more reliable and productive. 
  
  While feedback loops and machine learning methods are extremely useful in data science, jumping right to algorithm development skips over vital conversations that help to determine what the business problem truly is, and how a solution can best be built. The process of design thinking allows stakeholders to reflect on what their needs truly are and dream up a solution to meet those needs. Utilizing the prescriptive analytics of feedback loops and discipline of machine learning ops helps make those dreams a reality. The future of AI and data science is in utilizing these techniques together in an innovative way to develop the best solutions.
